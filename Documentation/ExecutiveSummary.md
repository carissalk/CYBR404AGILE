## Executive Summary
Describe the problem, the process to solve the problem, the proposed solution, and the expected deliverables. Include security concerns.
### The Problem
Discord users are perpetually adopting new, absurd bots to entertain their servers. The problem with plain text is that it is boring. Discord users would appreciate something different to bring into their text conversations within servers.
### The Process to Solve the Problem
Discord bots can utilize the capabilities of languages like Python. In the case of our TTE bot, we will be using Python and Python libraries to enable more powerful capabilities within text 'translation'. 
### The Proposed Solution
The solution proposed by TTE bot in response to boring text messages is emoji messages. The TTE bot will accept the boring messages and run a Python script to 'translate' the text into emojis. This will inflict harmless chaos and potentially hilarious interactions for the Discord users to enjoy.
### Expected Deliverables
The expected deliverable for this solution is a bot that can be invited to Discord servers for the purpose of translating text to emojis. This bot should be able to be activated by users and easy to use. Because the bot is purely for entertainment, it is important that it be simple to get started with and easy for server members to adopt.
### Security Concerns
Because this is a bot that will be added to servers with abilities to interact with the server and users, we need to avoid unauthorized use of the bot maliciously. In order to keep servers secure, we need to be careful of where sensitive tokens are stored as we develop this bot.
