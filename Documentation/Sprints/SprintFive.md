# Fifth Sprint
#### ***04/05/24 - 04/08/24***

### Sprint Summary:
This sprint continues bot hosting and testing hosting. The hosting methods we plan to use took time to process, so we focused the previous sprint on some of the milestones for this sprint. This sprint will be a mixture of both sprint milestones, so there will also be implementation of toggle commands from users including help and setting commands.

### Outcomes Required to Finish the Sprint:
  - prototype #5
  - continuing bot hosting
  - refining text replacement function
  - toggle commands (help & settings)
