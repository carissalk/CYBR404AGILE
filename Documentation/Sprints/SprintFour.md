# Fourth Sprint
#### ***04/03/24 - 04/05/24***

### Sprint Summary:
This sprint involves researching options for bot hosting and testing hosting. Additionally, there will be research on toggle commands from users in preparation for the next sprint involving help and setting commands. Because there were waiting periods in testing the implementation of bot hosting options, this milestone will be deferred to Sprint 5. In the meantime, we made progress toward the milestones originally planned for Sprint 5. The next sprint is expected to finalize both sets of milestones. 

### Outcomes Required to Finish the Sprint:
  - prototype #4
  - bot hosting
  - research on toggle commands
