# First Sprint
#### ***03/27/24 - 03/29/24***

### Sprint Summary:
This first sprint involved the necessary decisions following our project selection of the TTE (text-to-emoji) Discord Bot. We then laid a base for further work on the project. This involved getting a bot set up to interact with Discord. Each member did sufficient research to understand the tools and process for a Discord bot project.

### Outcomes Required to Finish the Sprint:
  - A bot that interacts with Discord <br>
  - Individual Research about Discord Bot Implementation <br>
